## Overview

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with
- ‚öõÔ∏è React (component-based architecture)  
- üé® Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)  
- ‚ö° Vite (lightning-fast dev environment)  
- üì± Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned
This project helped me:
- Deepen my understanding of **React Router** for page navigation.  
- Get more comfortable managing **complex Tailwind class combinations** for layout.
- Handle **responsive images and typography scaling**.  

### Continued development
I plan to:
- Add **Framer Motion animations** for smoother transitions between pages.  
- Replace static data with **real API calls** (e.g., space news or NASA data).  
- Experiment with **dark mode support** and other UI improvements.  
- Refactor for more reusable components as I continue refining my React patterns.  

### Useful resources
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) ‚Äì My go-to for styling decisions.  
- [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) ‚Äì Super helpful for routing logic.
